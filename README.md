# File Packer

File Packer is a VS Code extension that allows you to gather important project files into a single `.txt` for easy sharing on AI Tools.

### Note: This project is currently under development, and I am learning how to build this extension.

## Features

- Recursively scans a folder for specified file extensions.
- Excludes common ignore directories (e.g. `node_modules`, `.git`).
- Exports to a single text file.

## Usage

Get this extention from https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=AshutoshNandanwar.file-packer
or directly search for "File Packer" in VS Code Extensions Panel

1. Right-click on a folder in the Explorer.
2. Select **File Packer** from the context menu.
3. Choose a save location, and optionally rename the output file.
4. Done! Youâ€™ll have one file containing all your important project files.
